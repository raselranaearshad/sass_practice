# Sass @content Directive
The `@content` directive in Sass is a powerful feature that allows you to pass a block of styles to a mixin for more flexible and reusable code. 
```scss
@mixin my-mixin {
  // Main Body
  @content;
}

.element {
  @include my-mixin {
    // Content goes here!
  }
}
```
* **Define the mixin:** Create a mixin using the `@mixin` directive, followed by the mixin name.
* **Place the `@content` directive:** Inside the mixin body, insert the `@content` directive to mark the placeholder where the content will be inserted.
* **Use the mixin:** To use the mixin, include it in a CSS rule using the `@include` directive.
* **Provide content:** Within the `@include` block, provide the content that you want to be inserted into the placeholder defined by the `@content` directive.

### Key Points:

* The `@content` directive provides a flexible way to create reusable stylesheets.
* You can nest multiple `@content` directives within a mixin.
* The content inserted into the `@content` directive can include any valid Sass syntax.
