# Sass Variable
***
Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think youâ€™ll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable.
### Example:
```scss
$font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: red;

body{
  font-family: $font-family;
  color: $primary-color;  
}
```

When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the `$font-family` and `$primary-color` and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS.
